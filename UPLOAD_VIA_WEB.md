## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "File too large"
- GitHub has a 100MB file size limit
- Our ZIP is only 0.4 MB, so this shouldn't happen
- If it does, try uploading files in smaller batches

### "Can't upload folder"
- Extract ZIP first, then upload individual files
- Or use GitHub Desktop (recommended)

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Make sure you have write access to the repository

### "Repository not found"
- Make sure the repository exists: https://github.com/Taibur-Rahaman/Multi-Tenant-CRM-System
- If it doesn't exist, create it first:
  1. Go to: https://github.com/new
  2. Name: `Multi-Tenant-CRM-System`
  3. Click "Create repository"
  4. Then follow upload steps
